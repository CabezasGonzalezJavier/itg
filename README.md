# About
  

    - This project:
       MVP I chose MVP(Model, View, Presenter),MVP pattern allows separate the presentation 
       layer from the logic, so that everything about how the interface works is separated 
       from how we represent it on screen. 
       
       JSON, I chose JSONObject, a modifiable set of name/value mappings. Names are unique, 
       non-null strings. Values may be any mix of JSONObjects, JSONArrays, Strings, Booleans, 
       Integers, Longs, Doubles or Null.
